// uniform names are the cross-file contract of plan section 2.4.
// GLES3 equivalence assumption: nothing here beyond the GL3.3 core /
// GLES3 / WebGL2 intersection (code-standards section 7).

// World base pass: diffuse * lightmap(style 0) * overbright factor.
// Stock-parity factor measured against the pinned engine (T2 A/B, ratio was
// exactly 1.5 with a plain 2.0): the classic non-VBO overbright path blends
// the lightmap pass with glBlendFunc(GL_DST_COLOR, GL_SRC_COLOR) (= x2) AND
// a 128/192 vertex color (= x2/3), so the net factor is 4/3 (gl_rsurf.c
// R_BlendLightmaps). Upload already applied the engine light gamma table
// (see csz_lightmap.cpp).
